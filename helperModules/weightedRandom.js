/**
 * Picks the random item based on its weight.
 * The items with higher weight will be picked more often (with a higher probability).
 *
 * For example:
 * - items = ['banana', 'orange', 'apple']
 * - weights = [0, 0.2, 0.8]
 * - weightedRandom(items, weights) in 80% of cases will return 'apple', in 20% of cases will return
 * 'orange' and it will never return 'banana' (because probability of picking the banana is 0%)
 *
 * @param {any[]} cubes
 * @returns {{cube: any, index: number}}
